# note_analysis_2stage_tasks
Code for the simulations discussed in the paper "A note on the analysis of two-stage task results: how changes in task structure affect what model-free and model-based strategies predict about the effects of reward and transition on the stay probability" by C. Feher da Silva and Todd A. Hare.

It is written in Python 3 and requires numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.
